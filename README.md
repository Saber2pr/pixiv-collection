# pixiv-collection

> A repo of paintings I like, collected from pixiv.net

> There is an author-infor of each painting.

> If you are the author of some painting and it's of great bad to place them in here you think, please contact with me and I will remove them immediately.

> All paintings use a name, coming from the link where it is published firstly and encoded in base64.

> How to decode base64? Tap `F12`, and call a function named `atob` with the painting name as argument, then tap `Enter`, the result will come out. If it is too hard to you, here is a easier way to do that now, please click [here](https://saber2pr.github.io/base64-app/)
